## Issues To Be Clarified
- How are PPE supplies distributed from chemistry stores?
- How are sharps containers disposed of in chemistry?

## Access
The preparation tasks will be carried out by key users, which are already
approved for building access. The above schedule is to be strictly adhered to;
any changes need to be discussed beforehand with the head of section.
The established procedures for access need to be followed (email to Sally Dady,
sign in/out at the night entrance).

## Work Protocols
Since the goal is to provide a clean (i.e., virus-free) work environment,
it is necessary to adhere to very strict hygiene protocols while carrying out
these preparation tasks. This means that
- **face masks** need to be worn at all times while in B27
- **gloves** need to be worn while working inside the lab.
They are to be put on *only after* entering the lab where the work is to be
carried out, according to the following protocol:
1. sanitise hands
2. put on gloves
3. sanitise the outside of the gloves again.
Gloves must be taken off and discarded every time the lab is left (e.g. to go to
the toilet).

The reason for this is that we are treating the corridors and
especially door handles as contaminated.


## Tasks

### De-Clutter
In the next phase, the labs will be operated on the basis that
all small items are only to be present on visible surfaces when they are
actively being used. This means that items such as
- hand tools
- connectors and cables (BNC, power cables, etc)
- small instruments (e.g., hand-held multimeters, thermometers, etc)
- samples
- glass ware
- bottles and containers with chemicals

are to be kept strictly either in the appropriate cupboards and drawers or in
transparent plastic containers that are labelled with user's names.
in some labs, chemicals are commonly stored on open shelves. The important
thing is that no items are left lying around on work surfaces.

As we get back into the labs, the working protocol will be that items
are to be taken out only when needed by a particular user, and returned
to their storage place *after sanitation* at the end of that user's shift.
This ensures that no one is exposed to items that have been touched by another
user, thus limiting the risk of surface transmission.

The task is to put away all items currently lying around. They do not need to be
sanitised at this point, since they have not been handled in months.

#### Checklist
- [ ] Lab checked for obvious signs of damage, water leaks, etc
- [ ] Work surfaces clear of hand tools, writing utensils, connectors, etc
- [ ] Water taps flushed for at least 1 min (hot and cold)
- [ ] Chemicals properly stored
- [ ] Solvent bottles checked for damage
- [ ] Ether bottles (THF, diethyl ether) checked for peroxides

### Protective Equipment
The task consists in making sure that all protective equipment is in place, and
easily accessible for anyone entering the lab.

**Gloves.** There will be a strict glove and sanitation policy in place in the NMR labs.
An area on a table near the entrance door in each lab will be designated
where gloves and hand sanitiser will be provided, along with a bin for
disposal of gloves. The task is to ensure that  this is in place.

**Safety Goggles.** Various labs have a box where a number of safety goggles
are stored for shared use. This is obviously problematic in the current
situation. Safety googles must be disinfected after use before being placed
back in to the container.

#### Checklist
- [ ] First aid equipment in place and in date
- [ ] Fire extinguishers in place and in date
- [ ] Lab gloves available
- [ ] Hand disinfectant available
- [ ] Paper for wipe-downs available
- [ ] Spray bottle with 70%IPA or 70%EtOH available
- [ ] Safety goggles container in place

### Clean surfaces
All work surfaces need to be wiped down with isopropanol regularly. This includes
- benchtops
- desks
- handles on doors (e.g., spectrometer consoles, cabinets, etc)
- computer mice and keyboards
- keypads and handles on instruments (oscilloscopes, etc)
- microscopes (control surfaces and oculars)

If the lab has a linoleum floor, this also includes wet cleaning of the floor
(mop and bucket is available in 27-2005). In the case of carpeted NMR
labs, this includes hoovering (I believe a hoover is available in
Weidong's office)

The task consists in doing this for the first time. After that, each user
will do the same at the end of their shift to the surfaces that they have used.
In addition, a complete surface wipe down of each lab will be done regularly
(e.g., once a week)

#### Checklist
- [ ] Benchtops and desk surfaces wiped down
- [ ] Major instrument keypads etc wiped down (where possible)
- [ ] Computer keyboards and mice wiped down
- [ ] Door handles wiped down
- [ ] Floor cleaned (wet/hoover as appropriate)

### Instrumentation
Instruments and electrical appliances must be checked for damage; some of
them may require some maintenance before they can be used again. The
checklist covers basic labs

#### Checklist
- [ ] Fridges and freezers: checked for function and ice-buildup
- [ ] Oil-based vacuum pumps: oil quality checked
- [ ] PAT testing in date for all appliances (if not provide list of those that are out of date)
- [ ] Instruments with water cooling checked for mold/algae
