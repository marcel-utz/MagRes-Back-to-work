# Risk Assessment

| Risk   | Mitigation |
|:-------|:--------   |
| **Spread of COVID-19 among MagRes researchers by air** <br> At the time of writing, droplets expelled into the air by talking, coughing, and sneezing seem to be be dominant vector of transmission of COVID-19. Researchers working in the same labs for extended periods are at risk of spreading the disease between them. | <ol> <li>Carry out as many research tasks as possible remotely. <li>Limit occupancy of labs to 2 (in some cases 3) persons at any time</li> <li> Designate teams of 2 researchers that stay together, such that they are only ever exposed to each other. </li> <li> Wear face masks while working in the same lab with another researcher</li></ol> |
| **Spread of COVID-19 among MagRes researchers by surface** <br> Surface transmission is less well documented; however, it must be treated as a definite possibility. While there is only scarce information specific to COVID-19, other coronaviruses are known to stay infectious on surfaces for up to 48h. Hard surfaces such as plastics, stainless steel and other metals are more problematic than absorbing ones such as paper, cardboard, and textiles. | <ol><li>    </ol>|
