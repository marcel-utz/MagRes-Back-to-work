# Risk Assessment

| Risk   | Mitigation |
|:-------| :--------:  |
| **Spread of COVID-19 among MagRes researchers by air** <br> At the time of writing, droplets expelled into the air by talking, coughing, and sneezing seem to be be dominant vector of transmission of COVID-19. Researchers working in the same labs for extended periods are at risk of spreading the disease between them. | <ol> <li>Carry out as many research tasks as possible remotely. <li>Limit occupancy of labs to 2 (in some cases 3) persons at any time</li> <li> Designate teams of 2 researchers that stay together, such that they are only ever exposed to each other. </li> <li> Wear face masks while working in the same lab with another researcher</li></ol> |
| **Spread of COVID-19 among MagRes researchers by surface** <br> Surface transmission is less well documented; however, it must be treated as a definite possibility. While there is only scarce information specific to COVID-19, other coronaviruses are known to stay infectious on surfaces for up to 48h. Hard surfaces such as plastics, stainless steel and other metals are more problematic than absorbing ones such as paper, cardboard, and textiles. | <ol><li> Keep benchtops and desks free from clutter</li>  <li>Wipe benchtops and desks with IPA at least once a week </li> <li>Wipe door handles, light switches, etc with IPA at least once a week </li> <li> Sanitise hand tools, small instruments, cables, etc after use </li> <li> sanitise instrument keypads, computer keyboards, mice etc after use </ol>|
| **Spread of COVID-19 among MagRes researchers by cold-stored chemicals** <br> Many chemicals and samples are stored either in a fridge or freezer. There are indications that at low temperatures, the virus causing COVID-19 can remain infectious for much longer periods of time than on surfaces at room temperature. | Sanitise the outside of all chemicals and samples (bottles, NMR tubes, rotors, zip-loc bags, etc) before use |
| **Failure to obtain help in an emergency** <br> The building occupancy is expected to be lower than during normal operations. This may mean that research operations are done in the NMR facility labs by only one person in a given lab, even though the lone working policy ensures that there are other people working on the same floor. An efficient alert system is needed that allows MagRes researchers to obtain assistance if necessary. | |

# Method Statement

### Lab Occupancy Management
Researchers who want to carry out work in a specific laboratory need to book a
slot for that lab on the online booking system. Each laboratory has a maximum
occupancy (2 in most cases).

### Academic Staff (Supervision)
*TO BE CLARIFIED WITH SCHOOL OF CHEMISTRY*

At all times when lab work is ongoing, at least one member of MagRes has to
be on call, and researchers must have an easy way of contacting them. Usually
this is organised through a group chat on Microsoft teams, and researchers
can reach their supervisor through a teams call when necessary.


### Buddy System
Researcher "buddy" teams of 2 are defined, and only those in the same team
are allowed to be in the same laboratory for extended periods of time
(more than 10 min).  

### Working Practice

**When entering the lab:**
1. sanitise or wash hands
2. put on gloves
3. sanitise the outside of the gloves
4. wear a face mask

**While working in the lab:**
1. maintain social distance (>2m) as much as possible
2. minimise conversation, especially at close range
3. avoid touching your face
4. if necessary, cough or sneeze into your elbow, *not* into your hands; if necessary, dispose of gloves and put on new ones (see above)
5. when taking out tools, cables, etc, from drawers, leave them on work surface after use (do *not* replace items into drawers, this is only done at the end of your shift)

**When leaving the lab:**
1. sanitise all used tools and small objects, and put them away in drawers
2. sanitise instrument keypads, keyboards, and mice that have been used
3. remove gloves and dispose of them
4. sanitise hands
